## :speech_balloon: REST

### Files

Filename | Description
--- | ---
`openapi/types.rs` | Data types used for REST requests and replies.
`cargo-rest/src/lib.rs` | Imports the REST types file to create the `svc-cargo-client-rest` library, usable by other Rust crates.
`cargo-grpc/src/grpc.rs` | Autogenerated GRPC client stubs usable by other Rust crates to easily communicate with the GRPC server of this service.

### Authentication

See the High-Level Services ICD.

### Endpoints

See our [public documentation](https://www.arrowair.com/docs/documentation/services/api/rest/develop#tag/svc-cargo) for a full API.

## :speech_balloon: gRPC

### Files

These interfaces are defined in a protocol buffer file, [`grpc.proto`](../proto/grpc.proto).

### Integrated Authentication & Encryption

See Services ICD.

### gRPC Server Methods ("Services")

gRPC server methods are called "services", an unfortunate name clash with the broader concept of web services.

| Service | Description |
| ---- | ---- |
| `IsReady` | Returns a message indicating if this service is ready for requests.<br>Similar to a health check, if a server is not "ready" it could be considered dead by the client making the request.
